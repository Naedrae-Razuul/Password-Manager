# Password-Manager
Console-Based password manager. Not polished AT ALL. Just made to work with limited function. Spent around 6 hours on this project. (yes, i am a noob.)


info file will be created once a master account is attempted to be created. If you want to bypass the creation of the info folder, 
just create a folder named 'info' in the same directory as the main.py script. Simple as that.
